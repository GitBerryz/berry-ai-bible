            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: [Month Day, Year]</p>
            <p>Berry AI Bible (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and the controls you have when using the Berry AI Bible iOS application.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account-free usage:</strong> You can use Berry AI Bible without creating an account. Scripture browsing, study history, and personal notes remain stored locally on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Diagnostic data:</strong> With your permission, the app may collect crash logs and basic, aggregated usage analytics (e.g., feature popularity, anonymized performance metrics). This data helps us troubleshoot and improve the experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> When you contact support, we store the details you provide (email address, device info, logs) solely to resolve your request.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How AI Features Process Data</h2>
            <p>Berry AI Bible prioritizes on-device processing through Apple Intelligence whenever available. Reflections, study prompts, and search enhancements operate locally and never leave your device. If you enable optional cloud processing (for devices that do not support Apple Intelligence), prompts are sent securely to our trusted inference service, processed transiently, and immediately discarded. We do not build profiles or reuse your spiritual content for model training.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Optional Cloud Processing</h2>
            <p>Cloud fallback is disabled by default. If you opt in, requests are transmitted using industry-standard encryption and processed in data centers located in the United States. No scripture notes, prayers, or study content are stored after the response is returned. You may disable cloud processing at any time in Settings, and all subsequent requests will stay on-device.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Retention</h2>
            <p>Diagnostic logs and analytics summaries are retained for up to 12 months, after which they are deleted or aggregated. Support tickets are retained for as long as necessary to resolve your issue and comply with legal obligations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple:</strong> App distribution, in-app purchases, and crash reporting may leverage Apple services such as TestFlight and App Store Connect.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics provider (optional):</strong> If enabled, we may use a privacy-focused analytics tool that stores only aggregated, non-identifying metrics. No personal scripture content is shared.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud inference (optional):</strong> When enabled, we may use a trusted AI infrastructure provider solely to generate requested reflections. Data is processed ephemerally.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>User Rights & Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Disable cloud processing at any time within Settings.</li>
                <li>Clear local history, notes, and downloads directly from the app.</li>
                <li>Opt out of analytics collection through system privacy settings.</li>
                <li>Request deletion of support communications by emailing us.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>No Sale of Personal Data</h2>
            <p>We never sell, rent, or trade your personal information. Diagnostic data is used only to improve Berry AI Bible.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>The app is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us so we can delete it promptly.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We use industry-standard encryption in transit, safeguard local storage with Apple-provided protections, and limit employee access to diagnostics.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy as we add new features. Material changes will be communicated in-app or via release notes, and we will update the “Last Updated” date above.</p>
        </section>
